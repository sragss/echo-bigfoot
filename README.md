# Echo Nano Banana
Minimal lines-of-code to monetize apps calling Google's new Nano Banana model.

![Example](imgs/ex.png)


Fork and remix this to make a much more opinionated revenue-generating app in 15 minutes.


# Development
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

To point revenue at your own app go to [echo.merit.systems](https://echo.merit.systems/), create a new app, and replace the `VITE_ECHO_APP_ID` in `.env`.
